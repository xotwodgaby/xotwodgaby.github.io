<p id="question">What does your project look/sound/smell/feel like? </p>
<br>
<p>
-- My project consists of all sorts of smells that you’d experience when you’re at a carnival or faire.<br><br>
Smell: The smell of cotton candy, popcorn and sweet fragrances.<br><br>
Sound: Introducing the sound to this album, I’d like to say that I definitely recommend listening to Astroworld , which is an album by Travis Scott. Basically, the concept of this art piece is simply a homage to the song.
“Butterfly Effect” by Travis Scott is most definitely the inspiration as it’s been one of my favorite songs for a very long time. <br><br>
Look: The look of the project is supposed to project a feeling of being on a roller coaster and what it feels like to listen to a song of the psychedelic genre, WITHOUT BEING ON PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS.<br>
Feel: The feel of this piece is fun, eye-grabbing, and something that could delight deepest imaginations.<br><br>

<p id="question"> What is the conceptual/personal/political motivation behind the project?</p>
<br>
<p>
The concept of this art piece is introducing my thought process when listening to the album, Astroworld by Travis Scott.The album itself pays homage to the once known “Six Flags Astroworld” theme park that used to exist in Houston, TX. The city of Houston took down the theme park for certain reasons and that of course upset a lot of young children and adults. Travis Scott claimed that he wanted his 3rd album to figuratively feel like you’re on a theme park ride. I applied the same concept to this art piece.<br><br><br>

<p id="question"> What is the intended context? Where/how does the audience experience it?</p>
<br>
<p>
When looking at this piece, I’ve already observed different individual’s and their reactions towards it. Most people were very happy to see this piece as their eyes gazed all over the piece picking at certain aspects, especially with the amount of color drawn to each figure. Again, intending the idea of a theme-park and roller-coaster ride, there’s no intention on to whatever direction to look at first. I’ve seen a lot of individuals draw the most attention to the mouth as it is the centerpiece but also the “copper brick road”.<br><br><br>
<p id="question"> What/who are your influences for this particular piece? </p>
<br>
<p>
The song “BUTTERFLY EFFECT” by Travis Scott, which you can listen to here, is most definitely the inspiration as it’s been one of my favorite songs for a very long time since the song debuted in 2017. Simply the idea behind, “BUTTERFLY EFFECT” is the concept that small causes can have large effects. Simply meaning that one small action could either make or break anything that is in store for your future. I applied this to my own life and my own decisions as I’m constantly growing every single day becoming more independent and learning what life has to offer as a young adult facing the real world. The “wish you were here” text is in reference to Travis Scott’s “ASTROWORLD TOUR”, as he plastered it over tour merchandise pieces on sweaters and t-shirts.<br>
In reference to my art, the visible seen couple and child swinging image in the centerpoint of my art piece, was found on a website called WeHeartIt. I knew instantly then that I wanted to use it to express youth and innocence. In my own life, I’ve had my own faults at dealing with the definition of family, as I was the only child for 5 years, until my younger brother was born. As I’ve grown into a young adult, I’ve always felt somewhat of a “there-but-not-really-there”/”empty” presence from one of my parents. Due to this, I’ve created the idea behind the slogan “wish you were here” in the gif version of my art piece to express the idea of missing that individual’s influence in my life, as I feel like I’m constantly drifting away slowly from that parent. Again, referencing back to the idea of the “Butterfly Effect”, one small action (absence) could lead to a bigger action (isolation).<br><br><br>
