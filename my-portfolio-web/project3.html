<p> As you can tell, this is not where my full strengths are, when it comes to VR or 3D models. This was a very challenging project to do, especially because I was very & Adobe Premiere for video editing and Adobe Photoshop, Gimp. Illustrator, etc, for drawing. I configured myself into doing something that looks like what I am presenting to you. As you can see, based on where the shapes are placed, it isn't technically supposed to be like that, but it's purpose is defined when the constant array of thinking is unjust. When you're doing a project, specifically art, you have something in mind in particular but in the end, does it really turn out the way as you plan? Life is about trial and error, and this project just proved that it exists. The different shapes are used and mostly look like what is conducting the engines of a boat. Similarly, the lipsticks actually look like bullet cases. The randomness of this is figuratively put there as a reasoning because after each segment of object I added, it was added at a particular time a random thought popped into my head. You might just say that this project was essentially just a journal of it's own, but projection of a stream of consciousness that goes as far as it could go.<br>
